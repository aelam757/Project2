1. Jack - Push html routes and finish them up if necessary
2. Alan - Using company model as an example, create the benefits and ratings models
3. Micah - start working on the code to pass the company name from our form on 
   homepage.html as a URL query parameter to companyPage.html
   example:
   let companyName = $(#companyName).val();
   window.location.replace(`/companyPage.html?myCompany=${companyName}`)
   //hint - look at express query string examples


   SERIOUS CONSIDERATION - 
   create a "positions" model/table to keep track of open positions at a company
   -a position record should have a company ID foreign key (ex. Position.belongsTo(db.Company))
